    <content type="html">&lt;p class="ablog-post-excerpt"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The emergence of large language models (LLMs) with zero-shot generalization capabilities in sequence modelling
tasks has led to the development of time series foundation models (TSFMs) based on LLM architectures.
By representing time series as sequences of tokens, TSFMs can leverage LLMs’ capability to extrapolate future
patterns from the context data.
TSFMs eliminate the traditional need for domain-specific model development, allowing organizations to deploy
accurate time series solutions faster.&lt;/p&gt;
